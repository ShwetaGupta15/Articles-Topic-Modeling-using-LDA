# Topic Modelling using LDA:
Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning technique used to extract topics from a large corpus of text automatically. Topics can be defined as the co-occurring terms that are frequently repeating in the text corpus. Topic modeling is helpful in various tasks such as clustering documents, understanding and summarizing an extensive collection of textual documents and retrieving information from an extensive collection of data, etc. In this notebook I will perform topic modelling using LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

## Latent Dirichlet Allocation[LDA]:
LDA algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that works on a probabilistic statistical model to discover topics that the document contains automatically.
This algorithm works on certain assumptions. The assumption is that the document was generated by picking a set of topics and picking a set of words for each topic. In other words, we can say that the document is a probability distribution over the latent topics, and topics are probability distribution over the words.
